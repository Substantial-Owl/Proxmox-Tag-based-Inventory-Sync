## Ansible Module: Proxmox Tag-based Inventory Sync

This Ansible module allows you to synchronize the inventory in Ansible Tower/AWX with a Proxmox cluster based on tags associated with Proxmox nodes. It retrieves the tags from Proxmox and dynamically generates inventory groups in Ansible Tower/AWX based on those tags. The module incorporates security best practices to ensure secure communication and handling of sensitive data.

### Module Parameters

- `inventory_id` (required): The ID of the inventory in Ansible Tower/AWX to be updated.
- `proxmox_api_url` (required): The URL of the Proxmox API.
- `proxmox_token` (required): The Proxmox API token for authentication (sensitive data, not logged).
- `awx_api_url` (required): The URL of the Ansible Tower/AWX API.
- `awx_username` (required): The username to authenticate with the Ansible Tower/AWX API.
- `awx_password` (required): The password to authenticate with the Ansible Tower/AWX API (sensitive data, not logged).

### Usage Example

```yaml
- name: Sync Proxmox inventory with Ansible Tower
  proxmox_inventory_sync:
    inventory_id: 1
    proxmox_api_url: "https://proxmox.example.com/api2"
    proxmox_token: "your_proxmox_api_token"
    awx_api_url: "https://awx.example.com/api/v2"
    awx_username: "admin"
    awx_password: "secret"
```

### Security Measures

- **Token-based Authentication**: The module uses a Proxmox API token (`proxmox_token`) for authentication instead of username and password, enhancing security.
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: The `proxmox_token` and `awx_password` parameters are marked as sensitive data and are not logged or displayed in the output.
- **Secure API Communication**: SSL certificate verification is disabled (`verify=False`) for simplicity. In production environments, it's recommended to use valid SSL certificates and enable verification (`verify=True`) for secure communication.
- **Error Handling**: The module handles exceptions during API requests, providing better error handling and feedback.

### Notes

- Make sure to provide the correct API URLs and authentication credentials for both Proxmox and Ansible Tower/AWX.
- The module assumes that the tags in Proxmox correspond to Ansible group names. For example, if a Proxmox node has a tag "web_servers", it will be added to the Ansible group "web_servers" in the inventory.
- Customize the `generate_inventory` function to add or modify host variables according to your requirements.
- Ensure that the required Python dependencies (`requests`, `ansible`) are installed on the machine where you run the playbook containing this module.
- The module disables SSL verification (`verify=False`) for simplicity. In production environments, it's recommended to enable SSL verification (`verify=True`) for secure communication.
- The module requires the `requests` library to interact with the Proxmox and Ansible Tower/AWX APIs.

### Limitations

- The module assumes a one-to-one mapping between Proxmox nodes and Ansible hosts. If you have a more complex inventory structure, additional customization may be required.
- The module does not handle the deletion of inventory groups or hosts that are no longer present in Proxmox. It only adds or updates existing inventory groups and hosts.

### Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions about this module, please reach out to the Ansible community or refer to the Ansible Tower/AWX documentation.
