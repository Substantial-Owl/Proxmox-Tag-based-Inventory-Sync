# Proxmox-Tag-based-Inventory-Sync
This Ansible module allows you to synchronize the inventory in Ansible Tower/AWX with a Proxmox cluster based on tags associated with Proxmox nodes. It retrieves the tags from Proxmox and dynamically generates inventory groups in Ansible Tower/AWX based on those tags.
